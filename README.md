#Portfolio Website



Designed and developed a personal portfolio website to showcase projects, skills, and experience. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site features:

A resume.pdf
A masonry grid layout for an interactive gallery of personal and project images.
A social media section linking to GitHub, Instagram, X, and LinkedIn.
A "Get in Touch" button linking to a contact form for easy communication.
The website serves as a professional digital presence, reflecting my expertise in front-end development and UI/UX design. # portfolio-website
